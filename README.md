[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/548976004.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/548976004)

### 1) About

This work proposes a standardized Agri-NER task by defining a set of seven _contribution-centric_ scholarly
entities for Agriculture NER viz., _research problem_ , _resource_ , _process_ , _location_ ,
_method_ , _solution_ and _technology_ . 

The selected concepts were derived from the AGROVOC ontology [1].
